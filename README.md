# corona tracker app
This app shows live data of current corona positive patients.
This application showed data of no of patients that died, have corona or are recovered in India in total and also for different states of India Individually.
We used a public Api to display the data.
Which is now discontinued so one cannot see the data updated for present day.
This application was build in React native for implementation of Api calling and parsing JSON data in a FlatList.

To get it working one can pull the project and run 
`npm install to proceed`.
